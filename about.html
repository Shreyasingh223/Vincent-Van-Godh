                            He started working on The Potato Eaters. To develop as an artist,<br>
                            he first moved to Antwerp for a few months and subsequently to Paris.<br>

                        <p>Vincent spent the final months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise:<br> an artists' village near
                            Paris.
                            He made new friends and he threw<br> himself into painting. Yet after a visit to Theo,
                            Vincent grew
                            very <br>concerned about his financial
                            future. This uncertainty became too much<br> to bear on top of his
                            problems with his mental health. Vincent ended<br> his life in July 1890.</p>
